# Rethinking the Retail Strip

## Overview

MAPC’s [Rethinking the Retail Strip](http://rethinking-the-retail-strip.mapc.org) research seeks to understand and highlight the many low-density commercial “strip mall” sites around metropolitan Boston which have the potential to be reimagined and retrofitted into residential and mixed-use developments. These reimagined developments could allow for more walkability and commercial activity, while at the same time helping to meet the region’s housing and affordable housing demand, and boosting local tax revenue, all in an environmentally sustainable way.

In order to identify commercial sites in the region, MAPC analyzed land use attributes of parcel-level data. We measured the capacity of each site to develop new housing units—either as a fully residential or mixed-use development—accounting for environmental constraints such as floodplains, wetlands, and steep gradients. Finally, we conducted a suitability analysis to score the sites on the basis of their location and characteristics conducive to environmentally friendly, equitable, and profitable redevelopment. These factors include parcel size, walkability, flood risk, transit service, hazards, and sensitive habitats, and other factors.
